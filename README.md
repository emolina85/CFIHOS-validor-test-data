# CFIHOS-validor-test-data
This repository contains data for testing CFIHOS validator. 

The validation covers the following items: 
a) entities, 
b) attributes associated with each entity, 
c) data type of each attribute, 
d) data mandatory, 
e)integrity constraints between attributes, 
f) data integrity constraints between attributes values and RDL. 

The validation could be performed through two cases, one with two artificial completed and corrected files, one for the Owner and another for the Contractor, and another with real data extraction resulting from SPPID data base.
